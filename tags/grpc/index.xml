&lt;/h1>&lt;p>A few weeks ago I had the chance to participate in HackNC 2022. I chose the financial track.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tempest is a manager for trading algorithms. Basically, it is an abstraction between the systems for placing orders on the exchange, and your trading algorithms. I made this because when I used to run trading bots, it was very annoying to manage them. With Tempest you can write trading algorithms in whatever language you want &amp;amp; not worry about how their signals get turned into trades. In the future it would be awesome for Tempest to also manage deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, I was not able to finish all that I wanted, but I learned a ton along the way, such as: gRPC, interprocess communication, protobuf.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Narrowly avoided FTX going out of business and ruining the Exchange~Tempest part of my project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
