You can code apps without Xcode. Everyone knows Xcode can be a hastle some times, but it really is the best way to program iOS/macOS applications. You can build iOS apps just how youâ€™d build other software, but it gets annoying pretty fast. At some point, you will rely on the Xcode SDK/toolchain to sign your application for distribution.
