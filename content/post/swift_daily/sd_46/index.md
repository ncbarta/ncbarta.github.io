Little bit of a history lesson. As you probably know, Swift was made by Apple. However, it is now open source. It was made open source in December 3 2015, only a year after launch. People tend to criticize Swift for being an “Apple Language” yet it has been independent for years.

You can track the progress of the language on https://swift.org/ and https://github.com/apple/swift
