It is possible to make a linked list in 4 lines of code in Swift (but just because you can do something doesnâ€™t mean you should)

```swift
indirect enum LinkedListNode<T> {
    case value(value: T)
    case next(value: T, next: LinkedListNode)
}

switch currentNode {
  case .value(let value): print(value)
  case .next(let value, let next): print(value); currentNode = next 
}
```
