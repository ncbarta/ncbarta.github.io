SPM problems.

1. Errors are very hard to decode: You do not get a lot of info from the error logs.
2. Hard to get complete information: There are no good all encompassing guides.
3. Stuff gets outdated very frequently: You will sometimes have to download someone else’s code manually just to change the shebang at the top of their package file “// swift-tools-version:5.3”
4. Super complicated
5. File structure not always obvious
6. It becomes really hard to do more advanced things like link libraries
7. There are a whole lot of linking technicalities that SPM obscures, static vs dynamic, XCworkspace vs xcodeproj, ect…
