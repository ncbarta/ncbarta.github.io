Bitwise operators in Swift exist, and are just like bitwise operators in C, except that they will error on overflow. However, you can disable overflow errors with these special operators:

Overflow addition (&+) Overflow subtraction (&-) Overflow multiplication (&*)

You can also define your own operators such as a logical shift “\>\>\>”.
