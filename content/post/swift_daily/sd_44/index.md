Apple released a new API with iOS 15 called SharePlay. It’s basically a tool to sync media between people on a FaceTime call. For instance, you can watch a movie as a group - all while being physically distant. You may have heard that android users can now FaceTime too (with Facetime links), it’s all part of a FaceTime revamp.
